miller-rabin.py has a few false positives as follows (tested upto 10000)
2047 3277 4033 4681 8321
None of the above are Carmichael numbers
Miller Rabin will not work 64 bit C++. It may work on arbit precision library
For AKS, this number has to be reduced.
To calculate a bionomial coefficient, it is not necessary (wasteful) to 
calculate it from scratch. It may be calculated from previous coefficients.

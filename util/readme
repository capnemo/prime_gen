miller-rabin.py will print prime numbers up to a given limit
aks will test a number for primality or print prime numbers up to a given limit
new_aks.cpp is an optimized version of aks.cpp
For Pollard's rho see notes.
To be explored: Ullam's spiral.
The sequence sqrt(24n + 1) contains all primes except 2 and 3
The following code will produce the same sequence as (6k +- 1)
for i in range(1,200):
    s = math.sqrt(24 * i + 1)
    if (s == int(s)):
        print(s)
